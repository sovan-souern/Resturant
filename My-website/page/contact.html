            <p>The following web pages concern legislation on food contact materials (FCMs) in the EU.</p>
            <p>Food comes into contact with many materials and articles during its production, processing, storage, preparation and serving, before its eventual consumption. Such materials and articles include food packaging and containers, machinery to process food, and kitchenware and tableware.</p>
            <p>These materials are called <strong>Food Contact Materials (FCMs)</strong>.</p>
            <p>Constituents of food contact materials that transfer from these materials into the food may affect the chemical safety of the food and affect human health, as well as the quality of the food, its taste and smell, and its appearance.</p>
            <p>To ensure a high level of food safety, all food contact materials must comply with <a href="#">Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004</a> on materials and articles intended to come into contact with food when placed on the European market.</p>
            <p>In addition to this Regulation, all FCM must be manufactured in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP, <a href="#">Commission Regulation (EC) No 2023/2006</a>), and with specific Union legislation on certain materials, including on plastic and ceramics, as well as with National legislation.</p>
